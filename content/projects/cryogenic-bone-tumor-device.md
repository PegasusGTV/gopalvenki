A medical device engineered to remove bone tumors using liquid nitrogen cryogenic cooling, enabling minimally invasive treatment with improved patient safety and reduced recovery time.

**Motivation**: Bone tumor removal traditionally requires invasive surgery, leading to long recovery times and increased complications. Cryogenic ablation allows targeted tumor destruction while preserving healthy tissue and minimizing surgical trauma.

**Objective**: Design, model, and evaluate a cryogenic surgical tool capable of safely delivering extremely low temperatures to tumor tissue while maintaining structural integrity and thermal isolation.

**Methods**: Designed a sealed, vacuum-insulated chamber using SS 304 stainless steel for durability and biocompatibility. Integrated a liquid nitrogen cooling line for rapid temperature drop. Performed COMSOL Multiphysics simulations (2D & 3D) to analyze heat transfer and cooling gradients, thermal stress distribution, and safety margins for surrounding healthy bone. Optimized geometry and insulation layers to maintain steady cryogenic delivery during operation.

**Results**: Achieved rapid localized cooling suitable for tumor ablation. Thermal analysis confirmed minimal temperature rise in surrounding tissue, validating the insulation design. Stress simulations verified structural stability during extreme temperature changes.

**My Role**: Designed the device geometry, authored CAD models, performed all COMSOL simulations, and validated thermal/structural performance.
