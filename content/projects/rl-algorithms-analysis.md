Applied SARSA, Q-learning, and Dueling DQN across diverse environments, including Acrobot, Cartpole, and Taxi-v3. Leveraged advanced techniques like Monte-Carlo REINFORCE, SMDP-Q, and Dyna-Q in various gym environments. This project provided comprehensive analysis and comparison of different reinforcement learning algorithms across multiple benchmark environments.
