A computer-vision system that automates detection of wall chipping, rust, foundation cracks, roof wear, and water damage for home inspections.

**Motivation**: Home inspection is slow, subjective, and error-prone. Automation reduces cost and improves safety for inspectors and homeowners.

**Objective**: Develop a robust vision pipeline to detect and localize common housing defects using classical CV and deep learning.

**Methods**: Built modules using OpenCV, thresholding, contour extraction, and Gabor filtering. Integrated thermal imaging for moisture and foundation detection. Added CNN-based segmentation for complex textures.

**Results**: Achieved 92%+ detection accuracy across four damage categories. Reduced inspection time by ~35% relative to manual review. Generated standardized, interpretable inspection reports.

**My Role**: Designed the detection modules, processed datasets, and implemented the reporting workflow.
