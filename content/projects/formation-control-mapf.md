Developed GIF-PIBT, a cutting-edge algorithm that integrates global formation heuristics with the Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT) framework to maintain agent formations while ensuring scalable, collision-free pathfinding. Developed a multi-resolution grid system and formation-maintenance heuristic using cost functions and transformations, optimizing transitions between formation-based and individual strategies in dynamic, obstacle-rich environments.
