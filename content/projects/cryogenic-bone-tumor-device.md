Designed a medical device using liquid nitrogen cryogenic cooling to remove bone tumors with minimal incisions and reduced patient recovery time. Validated designs via COMSOL Multiphysics simulations (2D & 3D), optimizing heat transfer, stress, and safety using vacuum-insulated SS 304 construction.
