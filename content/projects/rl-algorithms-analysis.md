Implemented and compared SARSA and Q-Learning in Grid World environments, analyzing exploration strategies (ε-greedy vs. Softmax) and showing key differences in safe vs. optimal policies. Extended to deep reinforcement learning with Dueling-DQN and Monte-Carlo REINFORCE, demonstrating how architectural variations and baselines affect learning stability and performance. Explored hierarchical RL through SMDP Q-Learning and Intra-Option Q-Learning in the Taxi-v3 environment, highlighting how options accelerate convergence and improve policy efficiency.
